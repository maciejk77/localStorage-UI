# localStorage UI component

- set up a search box component to pass keywords to localStorage
  - limit number of stored searches i.e. 5, (remove the first in array, the oldest search)
  - store keywords without spaces and do not store values which are already in localStore

- create a pop up to list results, sorted (from newest on the top), scrollable
- add delete button next to each item, clickable link to redirect to certain URL

- persist data in database, adding, removing, fetching keyword/keywords list
